1. Line 9 would print out the ```sum``` of ```num1``` plus ```num2```. ```sumValues(10,10,true)``` prints ```values added: 20```.
2. Line 13 would be the ```sum``` of ```num1``` plus ```num2```. sumValues(10,10,true) prints ```final result: 20```.
4. Line 9 would print out the ```sum``` of ```num1``` plus ```num2```. ```sumValues(10,10,true)``` prints ```values added: 20```.
