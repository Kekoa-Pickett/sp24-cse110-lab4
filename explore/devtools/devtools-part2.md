1. The bug was that the input was being taken as a string so when added, the program just concatenated them.
2. I fixed it by subtracting 0 from each string value to turn it into a integer which allowed the program to add them as numbers instead of as strings. The picture is in my expand/screenshots folder under fix.png.
